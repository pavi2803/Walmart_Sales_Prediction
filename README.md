- **Negative Correlation**:
    - The plot shows a negative correlation between Unemployment and CPI. This means that as unemployment rates increase, CPI tends to decrease, and vice versa. The line drawn through the points suggests this trend.
- **Clusters of Data Points**:
    - There are distinct clusters of data points. These clusters might represent different periods or different conditions in the economy, such as recessions, expansions, or other significant economic events.
    - The CPI values are grouped into three bands: approximately 125-150, 180-200, and 210-225. Each of these bands corresponds to different ranges of unemployment.
- **Spread of Data**:
    - The scatter of data points shows variability, indicating that while there is a general trend of CPI decreasing with increasing unemployment, it is not a perfect relationship. Other factors may be influencing CPI beyond just unemployment.
