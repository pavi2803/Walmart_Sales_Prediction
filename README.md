    - There are distinct clusters of data points. These clusters might represent different periods or different conditions in the economy, such as recessions, expansions, or other significant economic events.
    - The CPI values are grouped into three bands: approximately 125-150, 180-200, and 210-225. Each of these bands corresponds to different ranges of unemployment.
